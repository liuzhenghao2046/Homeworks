Assignment 2 - 4481

My program does encode an image using the codes however It does not add a header to the file and does not decode the image. However it does find the frequency, Nodes or Pairs and the Huffman uniquely decodable code. 

During this assignment I had many problems with my GAUL account. Such as my quota being exceeded and not being able to delete anything to free up some space. 

Depending on my grade I may use this as my "slack assignment"
