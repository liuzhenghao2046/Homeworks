## Courses
### CS3336 - Web Development
#### Course Objectives

[Course Website] (http://babanski.com/teaching/cs3336a-web-development-fall-2013)

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to many important topics in web design and development. Areas covered include quick overview of HTML, XHTML, CSS and JavaScript. jQuery (with AJAX), XML and JSON are covered as well, as they assist in building efficient cross-browser web applications. The fundamentals of LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) model are covered comprehensively. The primary goal of the course is to teach students some of the advanced web technologies that are widely used by IT professionals to develop web-based information systems.

### CS3342 - Organization of Programming Languages

Specification and analysis of programming languages; data types and structures; bindings and access structures; run-time behavior of programs; compilation vs. interpretation. Comparative presentation of at least three programming languages addressing the above concepts. Languages used in this course include Scheme and Prolog.

### CS4481 - Image Compression

Dealing with digital pictures (images) requires far more computer memory and transmission time than is needed for plain text. This course provides students with a solid understanding of the fundamentals and the principles of various digital still-image compression schemes. 

- [Assignment 1] (https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS4481%20Asn1)
- [Assignment 2] (https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS4481%20Asn2)
- [Assignment 3] (https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS4481%20Asn3)
- [Assignment 4] (https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS4481%20Asn4)

### CS3340 - Analysis of Algorithms I

[Course Website](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Courses/CS3340b/)

Data Structures are methods of organizing data involved in computation. Algorithms are precisely stated, general problem solving methods suitable for computer implementation. Data structures and algorithms are central objects of study in computer science. Once appropriate data structures and algorithms are chosen, all that remains in most computer programs is routine coding. Moreover, data structures and algorithms go hand in hand: neither can be studied fruitfully without knowledge of the other. The course studies the relationship between data structures and algorithms. The course concentrates on techniques for evaluating the performance of algorithms. The relationship between inductive proof and creative evolution of algorithms is investigated.

#### Topics
- mathematical induction, big O nation, recurrence relations,
- Algorithm design techniques: devide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking
- searching and sorting, union-find,
- trees, red-black trees,
- string matching and sequence comparison, Huffman codes, 
- graph algorithms
- NP-completeness.

#### Assignments

- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS3340%20Asn2)
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/robinsone/Homeworks/tree/master/CS3340%20Asn3)

### CS3307 - Object-Oriented Design and Analysis

Software design and analysis techniques with particular emphasis on object-oriented design and analysis; a team project will be developed using an object-oriented language such as Java, C++ or Smalltalk.
